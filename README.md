# RobotCode9648
The tank drive robot code I made for FIRST Robotics team 9648

"Do I have to know how to code?" Nope! Although it does help a lot. Go to the wiki tab up at the top of the page and I'll do my best to teach you!

Please remember that FIRST could change anything and everything about their libraries and installation processes! There's a possibility this code stops working for whatever reason and you will have to fix it.

  HOW TO RUN (MY WAY):
1. Have all of the appropriate tools downloaded (WPILib, VSCode, FRC Driver Station) read the wiki tab for more details
2. Download the Robot.java file
3. Create a new project through VSCode and WPILib
4. Navigate to the project's Robot.java file (not the one you just downloaded!) it should be somewhere like C:\[your project's name]\[your project's name]\src\main\java\frc\robot\Robot.java
5. Select everything in your project's Robot.java file (not the one you downloaded!) and delete it
6. Navigate to the Robot.java file you downloaded from this github page and select all of the code, then copy it and paste into the project's now empty Robot.java
7. Hope that it works

  HOW TO RUN (WPILib WAY): read this https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/importing-last-years-robot-code.html
